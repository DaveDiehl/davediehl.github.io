<h3>Agile = Awesome?</h3>
There are many reasons to adopt agile, but the list must start with increased productivity. Businesses exist to
make money and agile proponents are quick to cite large increases in productivity when adopting agile.
For example, Jeff Sutherland talks about "hyperproductivity" with agile leading to increasing productivity by 800%.

This is an actual image of a business executive that has been promised a 800% increase in productivity:

<h3>Agile = Fail?</h3>
Yet many, many teams fail to come anywhere close to increasing their productivity by 800%.
Even signers of the Agile Manifesto have called agile <a href="http://blog.toolshed.com/2015/05/the-failure-of-agile.html">failed</a> or <a href="http://insights.dice.com/2015/05/14/is-agile-development-a-failing-concept/">dead</a>. Those same business leaders
who were promised that giant productivity increase now fail to see it.  

I have seen teams struggle with agile and fail to get increase in productivity. There are often many reasons for this,
and sometimes the same executives who champion agile will be the first ones to blame it if something goes wrong.

But is there something wrong with agile or is there something else going on?

<h3>The Hidden Ingredient is Frequent Delivery</h3>
The key ingredient to successful agile teams is the technical ability to deliver quality software on a cadence. <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/07/sutherland-agile-leadership">Jeff Sutherland says </a>,

> Any Scrum without working product at the end of a sprint is a failed Scrum. 80% of the scaled Scrum in Silicon Valley is in this category. They are 'Agile in Name Only.'

I don't know about Silicon Valley, but many Scrum teams I see also struggle to produce working software every sprint. If you raised the bar to delivering working software to **production** in every sprint, even fewer teams can achieve this level of excellence.

Agile often fails because teams lack the technical expertise and/or environment to deliver quality software quickly. Selling standups and process as a means to fix this is doomed to failure.  At best, these techniques can highlight the challenges.  But eventually, software professionals will need to fix the underlying causes or the projects won't go well.

That's why DevOps is critical for agile projects to be successful. Without the ability to release quality code quickly, your agile project will be a disappointment.
