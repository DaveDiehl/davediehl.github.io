<p>The promise of agile has been coming under fire.  Agile has been described as <a href="http://blog.toolshed.com/2015/05/the-failure-of-agile.html">failing</a>, <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/2385322/agile-development/why-agile-isn-t-working--bringing-common-sense-to-agile-principles.html">not working</a>, and <a href="http://insights.dice.com/2015/05/14/is-agile-development-a-failing-concept/">dead.</a></p>

<p>Why are so many people disappointed with agile results? Certainly there are many reasons, and they span poor process, poor implementation, and poor management.  There's no one size fits all problem or solution.</p>
