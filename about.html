<h4>Who is Dave?</h4>
<p>Dave Diehl is an experienced agile coach, software developer, and project manager. He has written software
in the retail, financial, and defense sectors. In the last few years, Dave has led the agile change initiative
at a Fortune 500 company and is now learning about how to make agile teams more productive with DevOps. </p>

<h4>Why DevOps?</h4>
<p>Without the ability to release quickly without quality problems, agile methods fail to meet customer expectations.
While it's great to demo the software every two weeks, what happens when you can't release it?

I'm excited to learn more about how DevOps can help teams be more effective by bringing the best of
process, tools, and technology. </p>
